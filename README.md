<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This was built for an interview test, it's a simple clean app which pulls JSON data from a server using AJAX, and outputs it into the App. Let's hope that it will land me the job :smile:

Highlights:
* I have tried to comment the code as needed and make the code as clean as possible
* I tried organizing everything into a simple structure

### Built With

* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [JS](https://www.javascript.com)
