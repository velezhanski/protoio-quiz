## About The Project
This app was created for the CS50 Final Project. I am a big fan of the Game Of Thrones so I decided to create a quiz based on the series. It's a simple clean app which pulls JSON data from a server using AJAX, and outputs it into the App. I believe that the course really helped me in understanding the generic side of coding and development. And it was really interesting :smile:
Anayways, so what the app is, is a quiz, where you have different types of selectors and in the end of the quiz you will get your score calculated based on the correctness of your answers.
